📌 Project Description:

This is a steganography tool that allows users to hide and retrieve secret messages within images. The tool provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter and leverages OpenCV for image processing.

🚀 Features:

✅ Hide secret messages inside images
✅ Retrieve hidden messages from encrypted images
✅ Password protection for added security
✅ User-friendly GUI for easy operation
✅ Supports PNG and JPEG image formats
